# Types of Graph

- [Directed Graph](#1-directed-graph)
- [Undirected Graph](#2-undirected-graph)
- [Digraph](#3-digraph)
- [Mixed Graph](#4-mixed-graph)

### 1. Directed Graph

A graph is said to be directed if an edge (*u*, *v*) is said to directed from *u* to *v* if the pair (*u*, *v*) is ordered, with *u* preceeding *v*.

### 2. Undirected Graph

A graph is said to be undirected if an edge (*u*, *v*) is said to be ***undirected*** if the pair (*u*, *v*) is not ordered. An undirected edges are sometimes denoted with set notation {*u*, *v*}.

### 3. Digraph

A graph whose edges are all directed.

### 4. Mixed graph

A graph that has both directed and undirected edges is often called a ***mixed graph***.
