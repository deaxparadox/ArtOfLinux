# Bash Completion

Bash completion helps you in finding the command you need, and it also works on variables and filesnames, and on some occasions event within command shells that are opened.

Bash completion is used most on commands. Just type the begining of a command and press the **Tab** key on your computer's keyboard. If there is only one option for completion, bash will complete the command automatically for you. If there are several options, you need to press the **Tab** key once more to get an overview of all the available options.
