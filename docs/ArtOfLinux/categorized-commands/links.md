# Link files

Linking files is a great option available in the linux filesystem. If you need to maintain two (or more) copies of the same file on the system, instead of having separate physical copies, you can use one physical copy and mulitple virtual copies, called *links*.

In the windows system, we must have used *shortcuts*, which are used in the Desktop to reference files from different locations.

Similarly, a link is a placeholder in a directory that points to the real location of the file. Two types of file links are available in the Linux:

1. [Symbolic link](symbolic-link)
2. A hard link


### Symbolic link

A *symbolic link* is simply a physical file that points to another file somewhere in the virtual directory structure.
