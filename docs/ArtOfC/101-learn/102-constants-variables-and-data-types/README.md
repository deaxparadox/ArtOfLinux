2. **octal**: An octal integer constant consists of any combination of digits from the set 0 through 8, with a leading 0. Some examples of octal integer are: 037, 0, 0435, 0551.
3. **hexadecimal**: A sequence of digits preceded by 0x or 0X is considered as *hexadecimal* integer. They may also include alphabets A through F or a through f. The letter A through F represents the numbers 10 through 15. Following are the examples of valid hex integers: 0X2, 0x9F, 0Xbcd, 0x.
