# Navigating the Filesystem

Navigation commands used to explore the areas in the Linux system. When you into the system and reach the shell command prompt you are usually placed in your home directory. Therefore, you can use navigation commands to explore the filesystem.


#### Traversing directories

You use the **change directory** (**cd**) command to move your shell session to another directory in the Linux filesystem.

Syntax:

```bash
paradox@paradox:~$ cd /usr/bin
```

This will change you location to /usr/bin directory.



### Checking you current location

You can check your location in the linux filesystem using **pwd** command called *Present working directory*. The pwd command displays the shell session's current directory location.


```bash
paradox@paradox:/usr/bin$ pwd
/usr/bin
paradox@paradox:/usr/bin$
```
